# Research & First Principles: Starship-Part-Forecast-AI

## Core Concept: Entropy and Metal
"Entropy chews metal" - The second law of thermodynamics dictates the inevitable degradation of aerospace hardware.

### Sources
1.  **Feynman Lectures on Physics**: Volume 1, Chapter 41 (The Brownian Movement). Focus on the statistical nature of heat and entropy.
2.  **Elon Musk (2012 USC Talk)**: Detailed breakdown of rocket manufacturing costs reduced to raw materials (steel price) and the statistical odds of failure.
3.  **Prophet (Meta/Facebook)**: Time-series forecasting library to be tweaked for aerospace wear data.

## Key Insights
- Materials cost vs. System complexity.
- Degradation modeling from first principles.
