# NotebookLM Guidance: Starship Part Forecast

## Suggested NotebookLM Items
1.  **Audio Overview**: A deep dive into the physics of entropy and how it dictates part wear in rapid reuse cycles.
2.  **Study Guide**: A comprehensive guide on LSTM architectures for time-series forecasting in aerospace.
3.  **FAQ**: Addressing common questions about reusability costs and inventory optimization.

## Suggested Prompt
"Based on the included research documents, explain the mathematical relationship between launch frequency and entropy-driven part degradation. How does the Starship reuse cycle specifically alter classic inventory models? Synthesize a strategy for a 40% reduction in safety stock."

## Infographics

### Standard Infographic Prompt
"Create a one-page infographic summarizing the 'Entropy-Driven Demand' model. Use a clean, modern layout to show how launch frequency accelerates part wear. Include a 'Before vs. After Starship' comparison showing the 40% reduction in safety stock."

### Detailed Infographic Prompt
"Generate a detailed technical infographic titled 'The Thermodynamics of Rapid Reuse'. Break it down into sections: 1. Entropy Math (Matter Degradation), 2. Time-Series AI Architecture (LSTM/Prophet), and 3. Production Scale Impact. Use flowcharts to show the feedback loop between launch data and inventory forecasting."

## Gemini Canvas Visual Prompt
"Create an interactive dashboard visualization for 'Starship Entropy Modeling'. Include real-time sliders for 'Launch Frequency' and 'Material Stress' that dynamically update a 3D degradation curve. Add a comparison toggle for 'Baseline vs. Reusable' inventory levels, visualizing the 40% efficiency gain with animated bar charts."

## Theme
**The Thermodynamics of Reusability**: Deep, metallic blues and high-contrast orange (heat) highlights. Focus on the raw physics of thermodynamics meeting data-driven logistics.
