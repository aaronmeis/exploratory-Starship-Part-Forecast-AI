# Predictive Demand Forecasting for Reusable Rocket Parts

> [!NOTE]
> This is for exploratory learning and understanding and knowledge development with mockup data from Kaggle and NASA.

**Type**: Time-series neural net dashboard

**Description**: AI model that forecasts part needs for rapid Starship reuse cycles—factoring in launch frequency, failure rates, and cost drops from reusability.

**First Principles**: Matter degrades—heat, stress, cycles. No guesses, just entropy math and launch physics driving demand curves.

**Approach**: Incorporate scenarios where launch frequency accelerates part wear. Model the fifty percent safety stock Reduction from forty percent efficiency gains.

**Visual Context**: Starship assembly lines show the production scale that makes this forecasting critical.

## Overview
This repository explores predictive maintenance for starship components using neural networks. It focuses on the second law of thermodynamics (entropy) and first-principles analysis of aerospace hardware.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download data (see [data_links.md](docs/data_links.md)).
3. Explore notebooks in `notebooks/`.
